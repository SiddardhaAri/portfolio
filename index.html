        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a results-oriented Data Engineer with close to 3 years of experience designing and deploying scalable data pipelines across Azure, and AWS environments. My focus has been on building robust data architectures, optimizing performance, and delivering reliable solutions that make an impact. Whether that’s improving data accuracy, reducing redundancy, or cutting processing time.

At Wipro, I contributed in key projects like migrating on-prem systems to Azure, implementing data governance policies, and streamlining data flows using tools like Azure Data Factory and SQL Database. I also contributed to cross-functional efforts to enhance data quality and operational efficiency.

Beyond enterprise work, I’ve led academic and personal projects like an AI Tutor Chatbot that classifies user learning levels and delivers personalized AI/ML content combining FastAPI, Streamlit, ChromaDB, and PostgreSQL into a seamless, real-time app.

I enjoy solving real-world data problems, collaborating with engineering and analytics teams, and continually pushing myself to stay ahead in a fast-moving tech space. Always open to meaningful work that blends innovation with practical impact.</p>
